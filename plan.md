# YetAI Sports Betting MVP - Development Plan

## Project Overview
AI-powered sports betting and fantasy sports platform with advanced analytics and trade recommendations.

## Completed Features ✅

### Player Comparison & Advanced Analytics (January 2025)
- **✅ Enhanced Player Comparison Feature**
  - **Problem**: Player comparison was only showing basic biographical data (age, height, weight)
  - **Solution**: 
    - Fixed player ID mapping between Sleeper API IDs and internal database IDs
    - Added comprehensive analytics calculation from player stats
    - Implemented mock data generation for off-season demonstration
  - **Features Added**:
    - Detailed metrics comparison table with visual indicators
    - Clear winner indicators (👑) for each metric
    - Color-coded performance levels (green for elite, blue for good, gray for average)
    - Progress bars for usage percentages
    - Overall winner calculation with weighted scoring system
    - League-specific recommendations based on scoring type (PPR/Half-PPR/Standard)
    - Key advantages breakdown with specific numbers
    - Trending player indicators (🔥 Hot, ❄️ Cold)
    
- **✅ Analytics Data Pipeline**
  - Fixed analytics endpoints to properly map Sleeper platform IDs to internal IDs
  - Added season fallback logic (uses 2024 data when 2025 not available)
  - Corrected week selection to match available data (weeks 8-12)
  - All endpoints now return properly structured data:
    - `/api/fantasy/analytics/{player_id}` - Player analytics by week
    - `/api/fantasy/analytics/{player_id}/trends` - Usage trends over time
    - `/api/fantasy/analytics/{player_id}/efficiency` - Efficiency metrics
    - `/api/fantasy/analytics/{player_id}/matchup/{opponent}` - Matchup history

- **✅ Frontend Display Enhancements**
  - Modern, clean table design with gradient headers
  - Hover effects and transitions for better interactivity
  - Responsive layout for mobile devices
  - Clear section separators (Usage Metrics, Efficiency, Fantasy Scoring, etc.)
  - Position-specific stats (RB: touches/carries, WR/TE: targets/receptions)
  - Comprehensive winner summary with scoring breakdown

### Fantasy Sports Trade Analyzer (December 2024)
- **✅ Fixed League Standings Display**
  - Resolved 404 "League not found" errors by fixing league ID mapping
  - Updated API to use `platform_league_id` instead of internal IDs
  - Implemented dynamic fetching from Sleeper API for real team names
  - Fixed frontend crashes with safe access operators and fallback values

- **✅ Trade Analyzer Player Data Fix** 
  - **Problem**: Trade analyzer showing 2024 season players instead of current 2025 data
  - **Root Cause**: Sleeper uses unique league IDs per season, not season parameters
  - **Solution**: 
    - Updated all default season parameters from 2024 to 2025 across backend services
    - Fixed league queries to properly map users to their current season leagues
    - Implemented automatic roster data sync when stale data detected (>1 hour old)
    - Added comprehensive user-to-league mapping logic
  - **Result**: Trade analyzer now shows current 2025 season player rosters

- **✅ Real-Time Data Sync**
  - Integrated automatic Sleeper API sync for roster data
  - On-demand refresh when trade analyzer detects outdated information
  - Proper handling of Sleeper's unique league ID structure per season

### Key Technical Improvements
- **Database Schema**: Proper mapping between fantasy leagues across seasons
- **API Endpoints**: Fixed duplicate endpoint issues and improved error handling  
- **Data Pipeline**: Automatic refresh of stale roster data from Sleeper API
- **Authentication**: Improved user-league ownership verification
- **Frontend**: Enhanced error handling and loading states

## Architecture

### Backend (FastAPI)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **External APIs**: Sleeper Fantasy Football API integration
- **Services**: 
  - `SimplifiedSleeperService` for API integration
  - `TradeAnalyzerService` for trade evaluation
  - `TradeRecommendationEngine` for AI-powered suggestions
  - `PlayerAnalyticsService` for advanced player metrics

### Frontend (React/Next.js)
- **UI Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React hooks and context
- **Data Fetching**: Native fetch API with error handling

## Current Status
- **Fantasy Trade Analyzer**: ✅ **Fully Functional**
  - Real team names and standings display
  - Current 2025 season player data
  - Automatic data sync from Sleeper API
  - Comprehensive trade analysis and recommendations

- **Player Comparison & Analytics**: ✅ **Fully Functional**
  - Advanced metrics comparison with visual indicators
  - League-specific recommendations
  - Overall winner calculation with scoring breakdown
  - Mock data generation for off-season demonstration

## Data Population Needs
- **Player Analytics Database**:
  - Currently only has 306 players with data (need all players)
  - Only 2024 season weeks 8-12 available (need 2020-2024 full seasons)
  - Using mock/random data (need real NFL statistics)
  - Need to integrate with real sports data API (ESPN, SportRadar, etc.)

## Technical Debt & Improvements Needed
- [ ] Populate comprehensive historical player data (2020-2024)
- [ ] Integrate real-time NFL statistics API
- [ ] Add caching layer for analytics queries
- [ ] Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
- [ ] Add more advanced metrics (DVOA, EPA, etc.)

## Next Development Priorities
- [ ] Sports Betting Analytics Module
- [ ] Machine Learning Model for Player Projections
- [ ] Real-time Notifications System
- [ ] Advanced Player Performance Metrics (EPA, DVOA, etc.)
- [ ] Mobile App Development
- [ ] Historical Data Population Script
- [ ] Integration with Multiple Sports Data Providers

## Recent Commits
- `2025-01-05`: Enhanced player comparison with visual indicators and league recommendations
- `2025-01-05`: Fixed player ID mapping for analytics endpoints
- `2024-12-XX`: Fix fantasy trade analyzer to show current 2025 season player data

## Notes
- Sleeper API structure requires unique league IDs per season (no season parameters)
- Automatic data sync ensures users always see current roster information
- Trade analyzer provides AI-powered recommendations based on team needs and player values
