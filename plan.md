# YetAI Sports Betting MVP - Development Plan

## Project Overview
AI-powered sports betting and fantasy sports platform with advanced analytics and trade recommendations.

## Completed Features ✅

### Fantasy Sports Trade Analyzer (December 2024)
- **✅ Fixed League Standings Display**
  - Resolved 404 "League not found" errors by fixing league ID mapping
  - Updated API to use `platform_league_id` instead of internal IDs
  - Implemented dynamic fetching from Sleeper API for real team names
  - Fixed frontend crashes with safe access operators and fallback values

- **✅ Trade Analyzer Player Data Fix** 
  - **Problem**: Trade analyzer showing 2024 season players instead of current 2025 data
  - **Root Cause**: Sleeper uses unique league IDs per season, not season parameters
  - **Solution**: 
    - Updated all default season parameters from 2024 to 2025 across backend services
    - Fixed league queries to properly map users to their current season leagues
    - Implemented automatic roster data sync when stale data detected (>1 hour old)
    - Added comprehensive user-to-league mapping logic
  - **Result**: Trade analyzer now shows current 2025 season player rosters

- **✅ Real-Time Data Sync**
  - Integrated automatic Sleeper API sync for roster data
  - On-demand refresh when trade analyzer detects outdated information
  - Proper handling of Sleeper's unique league ID structure per season

### Key Technical Improvements
- **Database Schema**: Proper mapping between fantasy leagues across seasons
- **API Endpoints**: Fixed duplicate endpoint issues and improved error handling  
- **Data Pipeline**: Automatic refresh of stale roster data from Sleeper API
- **Authentication**: Improved user-league ownership verification
- **Frontend**: Enhanced error handling and loading states
